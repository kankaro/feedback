# Front End Workflow Boilerplate

This is a modern workflow for building websites or web applications template using Parcel along with Babel and Sass. The Sass architecture for this boilerplate follows the [7-1 architecture pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) which means that there are 7 folders and 1 file that imports them all to be compiled into a CSS stylesheet. For the Sass writing conventions just follow the [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es/).
